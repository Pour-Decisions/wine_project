| Feature | Description |
| ------ | ----|
| fixed acidity | most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily) (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)   |
| volatile acidity | the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste (acetic acid - g / dm^3) |
| citric acid | found in small quantities, citric acid can add ‘freshness’ and flavor to wines (g / dm^3) |
 | residual sugar | the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it’s rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet (g / dm^3) |
| chlorides | the amount of salt in the wine (sodium chloride - g / dm^3) |
| free sulfur dioxide | the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine (mg / dm^3) |
| total sulfur dioxide | amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine (mg / dm^3) |
| density | the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content (g / cm^3) |
| pH | describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale |
| sulphates | a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant (potassium sulphate - g / dm3) |
| alcohol | the percent alcohol content of the wine (% by volume) |
| color | color of the wine (red or white) |
| quality | rated by sensory observation of expert (score between 0 and 10) TARGET VALUE |
